# Email Authentication Upgrade Guide

## Current Setup
The appointment system currently uses SMTP with email username/password authentication for sending notifications. While functional, this approach has some limitations:

- **Security Risk**: Email passwords stored in environment variables

const msg = {
  to: email,
  from: {
    email: process.env.SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL,
    name: process.env.SENDGRID_FROM_NAME
  },
  subject: subject,
